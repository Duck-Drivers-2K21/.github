# Hello! We're Alex, Joe, Luke and Sergios. 

We're 4 students from the University of Bath. We've worked together on a few projects, some of which can be found on this page.

A lot of this is code from Hackathons, and probably aren't our best work :)

## parkn

We use Deep Learning and Computer Vision to detect parking spaces, and allow users to find somewhere to park their car.

Created for Bath Hack 2023.

## Playing Pong with Deep Learning

We train a variety of Deep Reinforcement Learning agents to play the Atari game Pong, for our Reinforcement Learning module at University.

Awarded 73/100.

## Duck Driver

We use a Raspberry Pi, a RC car and sockets to allow fellow students to drive a duck around campus over the internet.

Created for Bath Hack 2021, and awarded the "Most impressive" award!
