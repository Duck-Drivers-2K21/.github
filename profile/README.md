# Hello! We're Alex, Joe, Luke and Sergios. 

We're 4 students from the University of Bath. We've worked together on a few projects, some of which can be found on this page.

A lot of this is code from Hackathons, and probably isn't our best work :)

## parkn

We used Deep Learning and Computer Vision to detect parking spaces to allow users to find parking for their car effortlessly.

Created for Bath Hack 2023, won the "Most Impressive" award!

## Playing Pong with Deep Learning

We trained a variety of Deep Reinforcement Learning agents to play the Atari game Pong, for our Reinforcement Learning module at University.

Awarded 72/100.

## Duck Driver

We used a Raspberry Pi, a RC car and sockets to allow fellow students to drive a duck around campus over the Internet.

Created for Bath Hack 2021, awarded the "Most Impressive" award!
